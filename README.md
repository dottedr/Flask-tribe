Purpose of this repo:
Create a boilerplate for a scalable but still compact Flask app.

You can run the app using either Docker or pipenv

The only thing missing here to run the app is set of secrets. You can mock CONFIG_TYPE = config.DevConfig, SOME_SECRET, TEST_DB_SECRET, PROD_DB_SECRET, DEV_DB_SECRET in .env file

This is still work in progress, however, the main idea is laid out in the existing code.
